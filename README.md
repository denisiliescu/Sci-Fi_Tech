Description:  
  
3D Sci-Fi Game  
This game started with the project setup and importing the assets in order to develop it. Next, I have added our actual map from the assets and replaced the default skybox with a cloudy sunset. I have introduced our player which is basically a capsule game object, I’ve coded its movement and the mouse look in order to explore the area. Then, I baked a navigational mesh that our player can walk on in order to not make it fall through the map, implemented a crosshair, a weapon with muzzle flash effects and sounds and an ammunition system to let us know the remaining bullets. Following, I have introduced a coin that can be picked up and an inventory where we can see and store the coin. With the use of that coin, I have implemented the purchase of a weapon from the shark's store. Destructible objects were next and I have learned how I can make them look realistic enough by using particle effects. Finally, I’ve added a design touch through post-processing effect towards our game.
